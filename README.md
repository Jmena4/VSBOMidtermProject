### Collaborators
* Jesse Mena

### Overview
To wrap up Skill Distillery's Java/SpringMVC/JPA materials we built a full stack app as a group. The workforce consisted of 3 person teams working daily for a 1 week sprint. All students participated in all levels of the stack. 

Project required a fully developed database schema, and full CRUD functionality through JPA.  Project also required a user login backed by session ID.

One member of the team was selected to act as Scrum Master, one as a GitHub owner, and one as a Database Administrator.

The team held regular Stand-Up Scrum/Agile meetings in which they discussed their progress and shifted tasks to fit conditions, leading to a more dynamic project.
