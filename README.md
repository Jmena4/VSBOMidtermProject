### Overview
To wrap up Skill Distillery's Java/SpringMVC/JPA materials we built a full stack app as a group. The workforce consisted of 3 person teams working daily for 1 a week sprint. All students participated in all levels of the stack. 
One member of the team was selected to act as Scrum Master, One as a GitHub owner, and one as a Database Administrator.

The team held regular Stand-Up Scrum Meetings in which they discussed their progress and shifted tasks to fit conditions.
